## Getting Started üèÅ

### Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo (latest stable release)
- PostgreSQL server running on localhost (default settings)
- Docker (optional, for running inside a container)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NRM10101/product-item-microservice.git
    cd product-item-microservice
    ```

2. **Configure the database connection**
    Edit the `.env` file to include your database connection string:
    ```
    DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:port/dbname
    ```

### Running the Application üöÄ

#### Locally

```bash
cargo run
```
This will start the server on `http://localhost:3000/`.

#### Using Docker

1. **Build the Docker image**
    ```bash
    docker build -t product-item-microservice .
    ```

2. **Run the Docker container**
    ```bash
    docker run -p 3000:3000 --name myapp product-item-microservice
    ```
    This will start the application and make it accessible at `http://localhost:3000/`.
