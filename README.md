# Product and Item Management Service

This project is an API service developed in Rust, utilizing Axum for the web framework and SeaORM for object-relational mapping. It's designed to manage products and items in a database, offering a suite of RESTful endpoints.

## Features 🚀

- **List all products**: Retrieve a list of all products stored in the database.
- **Get a product by ID**: Fetch a detailed view of a specific product by its unique identifier.
- **Delete a product by ID**: Remove a product from the database using its ID.
- **List all items**: Retrieve a list of all items related to products.
- **Get an item by ID**: Fetch details of a specific item by its unique identifier.
- **Update item details**: Modify existing item details like name and price.
- **Delete an item by ID**: Remove an item from the database using its ID.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **Rust**: A language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software.
- **Axum**: A web application framework that is particularly suited for building scalable web services.
- **SeaORM**: An async & dynamic ORM for Rust.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads.

## Getting Started 🏁

### Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo (latest stable release)
- PostgreSQL server running on localhost (default settings)
- Docker (if running via Docker container)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NRM10101/product-item-microservice.git
    cd product-item-microservice
    ```

2. **Configure the database connection**
    Edit the `.env` file to include your database connection string:
    ```
    DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:port
    DB_NAME=dbname
    ```

### Running the Application 🚀

#### Locally

```bash
cargo run
```
This will start the server on `http://localhost:3000/`.

#### Using Docker

1. **Build the Docker image**
    ```bash
    docker build -t product-item-microservice .
    ```

2. **Run the Docker container**
    ```bash
    docker run -p 3000:3000 --name myapp product-item-microservice
    ```
    This will start the application and make it accessible at `http://localhost:3000/`.
